You're right, we can simplify that section. Here is the updated `README.md` with the more direct instruction for running the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2\. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is a best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies.

```bash
# Create the environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

All the required Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them with a single command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Running the Project

The core logic for data merging, model training, and evaluation is contained within the `Formative_2_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook. After setting up the environment, simply run the notebook cells in order to see the results.
